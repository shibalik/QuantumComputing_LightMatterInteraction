# QuantumComputing_LightMatterInteraction
The Repository contains all the programs and figures that has been worked out during SURGE-2019
It depicts the behaviour of a Two level system on Interaction with Laser pulses
All of it ultimately allows us to create a model for coherent control of state in two level system to be utilized for Quantum computing
NOT gate,HADAMARD all other kind of single qubit can be applied in through this model
